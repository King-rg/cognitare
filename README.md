My first horrible attempt at a numpy based ML library. 

Really this project was more or so an experiment then me planning to make anything useful. I tried to apply my at the time limited knowledge in ML/AI and really challenge 
myself and find out what I was missing in regards to my understanding in forward and backward propogation.
